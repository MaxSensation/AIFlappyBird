## Presentation
When the game is running there's two different spheres jumping in between blue walls through a green area. The turquoise sphere is the bird using imitation learning and
The orange sphere is the bird using reinforcement learning. The numbers at the top with the text "score" left of it is the current highest score of the bird that has come the furthest.
If both birds die the game restarts from the beginning and the score is reset.
